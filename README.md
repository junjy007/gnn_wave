# Graph neural nets for wave modelling
This repository contains the implementation of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for
predicting wave characteristics in Darwin Harbour, Australia. The model
utilizes a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn spatial dependencies and
enhance wave forecasting accuracy. One can use this model to train and test
their own dataset.

The bibtex item will be inserted here upon the publication of the paper.

## Dependencies
See requirements.txt

## Data Preparation
The dataset is stored in NetCDF format, and the shape of each variable is node*time.
Train & test the Model

## Demo and test
The a sample small data set will be provided upon the publication of the paper.

See test.ipynb to find examples to train and test the GNN model.

Note, you may need to install visualization libraries to run the notebook code
sections. The libraries in requirements.txt are for the Python modules.
